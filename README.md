# Mysterious Organism

## NOTE: The development of this project is discontinued as this repository has been archived

Mysterious Organism is a miniproject that simulates and offers modification tools for P. aequor (fictional organism) specimens' DNA, written in JavaScript. 

> Pila aequor (P. aequor) is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the hydrothermal vents make P. aequor an interesting specimen to study. However, P. aequor cannot survive above sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and expensive. These being said, this projects simulates the 15 DNA bases, finds the complementary strand and creates statistics for the specimens generated for further research.
